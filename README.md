=====================

Alloy SQL Adapter that supports remoteBackup for iOS iCloud.

After submitting an app with a built-in SQLite database and getting rejected using the stock Alloy SQL adapter. I've modified it to support turning of the iCloud backup option.

As of Alloy 1.2.0 this will no longer be needed as my additions will now be part of the stock SQL adapter.
